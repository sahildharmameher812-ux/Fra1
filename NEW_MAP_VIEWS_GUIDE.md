   - Click on it to see all available map views
   - Select any of the new detailed views:
     - "🏞️ 3D Detailed View"
     - "🌳 High-Res Satellite"
     - "🗺️ Detailed Terrain"

3. **Zoom In for Detail**:
   - Use the **+/-** buttons or mouse scroll to zoom
   - Zoom levels 15-22 show incredible detail
   - At high zoom, you can see:
     - Individual buildings

✅ **Land Use**: Clearly distinguish between different land types
✅ **Settlements**: Tribal and rural settlements visible
✅ **Real Terrain**: Actual ground conditions and land features

### Best Practices:

1. **For Field Survey Planning**:
   - Use "🌳 High-Res Satellite" to see actual ground conditions
   - Identify access roads and paths to claim locations

2. **For Land Assessment**:
   - Use "🏞️ 3D Detailed View" for context with labels
   - Zoom in to see current land use

3. **For Topography**:
   - Use "🗺️ Detailed Terrain" to understand elevation
   - Identify slopes, valleys, and water drainage

4. **For Claim Verification**:
   - Compare satellite view with claim boundaries
   - Verify land features mentioned in applications

### Example Use Cases:

1. **Forest Rights Verification**:
   - Zoom to claim location
   - Switch to "🌳 High-Res Satellite"
   - Verify forest cover and land use

2. **Village Mapping**:
   - Select "🏞️ 3D Detailed View"
   - See village layout with labels
   - Identify community resources

3. **Water Body Identification**:
   - Use any high-res view
   - Ponds and lakes are clearly visible
   - Useful for community forest resource claims

### Performance Notes:

- Higher zoom levels may load slightly slower
- Best viewed with stable internet connection
- Maps cache for faster repeat viewing
- Works on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
