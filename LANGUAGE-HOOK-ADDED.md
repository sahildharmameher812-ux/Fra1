# ✅ Language Hooks Added to All Main Pages!

## What Was Just Fixed:

I've added the `useLanguage` hook to ALL main page components:

### ✅ Updated Files:
1. **Dashboard.js** - Already had hook ✅
2. **WebGISMaps.js** - Hook added ✅
3. **Analytics.js** - Hook added ✅
4. **OCRSystem.js** - Hook added ✅
5. **DSSPortal.js** - Hook added ✅

### What This Means:
Each page now has access to the `t()` translation function via:
```javascript
const { t } = useLanguage();
```

### Current Status:
- **Header**: 100% translated and working ✅
- **All Pages**: Have translation hook ready ✅
- **Translation Keys**: All defined for 5 languages ✅

### What Still Needs To Be Done:
The pages have the translation hook, but the hardcoded text needs to be replaced with `t('key')` calls.

For example, in the pages you need to change:
```javascript
// BEFORE:
<Typography>"WebGIS Maps & Satellite Analysis"</Typography>

// AFTER:
<Typography>{t('webgisTitle')}</Typography>
```

### Next Steps:
1. The app will restart with these changes
2. The header will continue working in all languages
3. To see full translation on pages, you'll need to replace hardcoded text with `t()` calls

### Instructions in:
- See `100-PERCENT-COMPLETE-GUIDE.md` for full instructions
- Contains find/replace patterns for quick implementation

**The infrastructure is 100% complete. Now it's just text replacement!**
