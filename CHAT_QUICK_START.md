  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    message: 'How does OCR work?',
    sessionId: 'my-session-123'
  })
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log(data.response);  // Smart answer
  console.log(data.confidence); // 0.96 (96% confident)
  console.log(data.category);   // 'documents'
});
```

## 🎓 Understanding Responses

Every response includes:
